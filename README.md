# Advent of Code
This repository contains the code I used to find my solutions.
The code is not afterwards optimised or refactored, but it's cleared from `console.log` where it's used instead of a debugging tool.
And the code might be manually prettified a bit for the reader's convenience.

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the challenges.
