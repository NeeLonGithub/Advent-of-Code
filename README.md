# Advent of Code
This repository contains the code I used to find my solutions.

For every challenge, the input is copy+pasted in the corresponding file and with the IDE tools turned into a usable JavaScript literal.

The code is not afterwards optimised or refactored, but might be manually prettified a bit for the future reader's convenience.

The first dozen challenges were run in the browser's console, which automatically prints the result of the last calculation.
For those early scripts to be run with `node`, an extra variable was added to `console.log` that variable.

Each challenge consists of two parts.
To get the answer for the second part, the code is often altered in such a way that the answer for the first part can't be found anymore.
The code as stored here will often only provide the answer for the second part of the challenge.
If it was easy enough to regain the first answer from the code, it was added in before uploading.

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the challenges.
