# Advent of Code - 2021
This year my goal was to get to the solution as fast as I could, using JavaScript.

For every challenge, the input was copy+pasted in the corresponding file and with the IDE tools turned into a usable JavaScript literal.
Often I found it quicker or easier on the mind to duplicate code or type with multiple carets instead of creating DRY code.
The code here is not afterwards optimised or refactored, but might be manually prettified a bit for the future reader's convenience.

The first dozen challenges were run in the browser's console, which automatically prints the result of the last calculation.
For those early scripts to be able to run with `node`, an extra variable was created to `console.log` that variable.

Each challenge consists of two parts.
To get the answer for the second part, the code is often altered in such a way that the answer for the first part can't be found anymore.
The code as stored here will often only provide the answer for the second part of the challenge.
If it was easy enough to regain the first answer from the code, it was added in before uploading.

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) for the challenges.
